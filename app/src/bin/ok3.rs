    // Step 2: Re-parse the string into the v2 Url type expected by mid_b.
    // This establishes a clean type boundary: from here onward, the value
    // is owned entirely by the v2 world.

    // âš  Note:
    // Although this "string bridge" prevents compile-time type errors
    // and runs correctly, it implicitly relies on url v1's `to_string()`
    // output being stably accepted by url v2's `parse()`.
    // Any change in canonicalization rules or textual conventions
    // (e.g., case-folding, default ports, percent-encoding)
    // could silently break this bridge.
    // Therefore, the approach carries hidden maintainability risks,
    // even though it appears safe at runtime.
